##BikeBike

**This is a base image for Community Bike Shop docker containers.**

It provides *MySQL* and *Ruby* since the majority of software written for the [BikeBike community](http://bikebike.org) utilizes this software environment.  However, this may just be a temporary solution, and in the future individual container may have the option to depend on other containters providing these environments.
