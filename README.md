##BikeBike

**This is a base image for Community Bike Shop docker containers.**

It provides *MySQL* and *Ruby* since the majority of software written for the [BikeBike community](http://bikebike.org) utilizes this software environment.  However, this may just be a temporary solution, and in the future individual containers may have the option to depend on other containers providing these environments.

Keeping things simple Supported Tags (Ubuntu Versions) are now being utilized:

* Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) - [14.04/Dockerfile](https://github.com/fspc/bikebike/blob/master/14.04/Dockerfile)
